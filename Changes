    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - use Git::Repository instead of Git.pm to interact with Git

0.07 Sat Jan  3 06:35:52 CET 2009
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - moved the stitching algorithm in its own module:
      Git::Fast:Export::Stitch
    - git-stitch-repo is now a thin wrapper around it
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - the stitching algorithm is documented in Git::FastExport::Stitch
    - the use cases are documented in git-stitch-repo
    [TESTS]
    - fixed the test repositories code
    - added tests involving stitching 3-way merges

0.06 Sat Dec 20 00:07:44 CET 2008
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - git-stitch-repo: greatly improved the algorithm for finding
      a suitable commit to attach to, avoiding inconsistencies:
      git-stitch-repo can now stitch non-linear repositories
      in a consistent way
    - git-stitch-repo: added an option to change the attachment
      commit selection algorithm
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - documentation improvements on git-stitch-repo, with a lot
      more ascii graphs

0.05 Sun Oct  5 01:22:53 CEST 2008
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - made Git::FastExport::Block an independent module
    [TESTS]
    - t/30stitch-repo.t now caches the source repositories used in
      the tests. This speed up considerably this test script after
      the first run (from 2 minutes to 2 seconds)

0.04 Wed Aug 20 22:04:30 CEST 2008
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - git-stitch-repo: fixed a bug that caused many commits/branches
      to be lost because different branches were given the same name.
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - improved documentation for git-stitch-repo
    [TESTS]
    - t/30stitch-repot.t actually tests the results of running
      git-stitch-repo on several different configurations

0.03 Mon Jul  7 19:29:23 CEST 2008
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - git-stitch-repo: fixed a segmentation fault that occured
      at program destruction, because of a huge self-referential
      hash of hashes

0.02 Fri Jul  4 11:03:54 CEST 2008
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - added a README file
    - added documentation for git-stitch-repo
    [TESTS]
    - added t/00load.t and t/01new.t to increase test coverage

0.01 Thu Jun 26 14:00:01 CEST 2008
